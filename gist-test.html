            Ok, so here I am now learning about GitHub "Gists". From what I gather, Gists can be used to share files or parts of files. It looks like the two most relevant methods for sharing are through embedding and simply posting links.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, we shall make a self-referential gist, because why not :P
        </p>
        <p>
            Hmm, well it's a bit strange because it's a "script" tag that we are given. So I puppose we start by trying to see what this even looks like and then see ,what happens. On that note, I need to get a docker container to spin a quick web server. I wonder if Nginx might suffice?
            </br>
            And indeed, it does. Thank you, <span title="docker run --name quick-serve -p 8080:80 -v ${PWD}:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d nginx" style="font-weight: bold">El Capitan</span>!
        </p>

            Our gist should be placed below.
            <div>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/artystable/6477288de26ac83aec1c16a6d0a73896.js"></script>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Ahh! And indeed it does! Yay! Another small victory.
        </p>

            The one thing I am not particularly fond of is how it looks like I have to basically create these separate files to reference files. But, on the other hand, it is nice how we do get this functionality for free, basically. That's nice.

            It looks like all gists can be found at "https://gist.github.com/your-github-username". Or in my case, <a href="https://gist.github.com/artystable">here</a>
