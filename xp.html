        I finally came up with an idea that seems sufficiently good to potentially dedicate myself for a longer period of time. In short, the idea is to create an information hub to facilitate the process of sharing ideas and learning about the process of experimentation; i.e. designing and executing successful experiments and gaining useful experience. I think I might purchase the domain name "xp.com" soon. Hmm, perhaps I should run an experiment on that.
