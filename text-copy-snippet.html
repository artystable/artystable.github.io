    <h1>Brief Clipboard.js Tutorial</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            In this article I cover a brief test of the clipboard.js library, found <a href="https://clipboardjs.com/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For simplicity's sake, I will use one of the CDNs found here <a href="https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/wiki/CDN-Providers"></a> as per the instructions in the clipboard.js info page. I am placing the script at the bottom of the body closing tag as I recall that was the appropriate method for js scripts (at least some years ago).
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, the info page instructs that I instantiate a "ClipboardJS" object with an input class for some element I will associate to this functionality. This, I do via a short "script" tag below the previously referenced one at the bottom of this HTML doc. Then I proceed to copy the code from first example in the info page, which is observed next:
        </p>
        <!-- Target -->
        <input id="foo" value="https://artystable.github.io/text-copy-snippet.html">

        <!-- Trigger -->
        <button class="btn" data-clipboard-target="#foo">
        <img class="clippy" src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/clippy.svg" width="13" alt="Copy to clipboard">
        </button>
        <p>
            Hmm, it looks like I have to change the image file (perhaps I will use fontawesome substitute). Ahh, nevermind, too much work to get all the setup. I will merely modify the src field to point directly to where the .svg file is hosted in the info page's site (for now).
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, with all of this done, I would hope everything should work as expected. But of course.. I know by now. So we shall see.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well that was actually easy. Indeed, after adding the little script to add styles to the giant button icon, everything worked just nicely. I also modified the link so now when the button is clicked, the text copied is the link to this very page. The style code is as follows:
            <div>
                <pre>.clippy { margin-top: -3px; position: relative; top: 3px; width: 13px; border: 0; }</pre>
            </div>
        </p>
